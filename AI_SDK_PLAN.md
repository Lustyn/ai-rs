# AI SDK for Rust - Project Plan

## Project Overview

Build a comprehensive AI SDK for Rust that provides trait-based abstractions for AI providers, type-safe tool calling, and streaming protocols with cross-language client support.

## Core Deliverables

### 1. Provider Abstraction Layer
**Goal**: Create a unified interface for interacting with different AI providers

**Key Deliverables**:
- Core traits for AI provider capabilities (text generation, embeddings, vision, etc.)
- Extensible data types for requests/responses across providers
- Provider-specific implementations (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, etc.)
- Configuration and authentication management
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

**Success Criteria**:
- Seamless switching between providers with minimal code changes
- Support for provider-specific features while maintaining common interface
- Easy addition of new providers through trait implementation

### 2. Agent Helper Functions
**Goal**: Provide high-level helper functions that handle execution loops and strategies

**Key Deliverables**:
- `stream_text()` function for streaming agent responses with execution control
- `generate_text()` function for non-streaming agent responses with execution control
- `RunUntil` trait for defining execution termination strategies
- Built-in strategies: max steps, stop reasons, custom conditions
- Execution loop orchestration with configurable stopping conditions

**Success Criteria**:
- Simple API for common agent patterns
- Configurable execution strategies (max steps, stop conditions)
- Seamless integration with existing provider traits
- Support for both streaming and non-streaming workflows
- Flexible execution control without tool dependency

### 3. Tool Calling Framework
**Goal**: Implement axum-like type safety for AI tool calling with compile-time guarantees

**Key Deliverables**:
- Type-safe tool definition macros/traits
- Input validation and serialization framework
- Guard system for tool access control and requirements
- Tool registry and discovery mechanism
- Execution runtime with error handling

**Success Criteria**:
- Compile-time verification of tool inputs/outputs
- Intuitive API similar to axum's handler patterns
- Flexible guard system for authentication, context, etc.
- Zero-cost abstractions where possible

### 4. Streaming Protocol
**Goal**: Type-safe streaming communication between AI services and clients

**Key Deliverables**:
- Protocol definition with versioning support
- Rust streaming client/server implementation
- Message serialization/deserialization with strong typing
- Connection management and reconnection logic
- Backpressure and flow control mechanisms

**Success Criteria**:
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Type safety across the wire
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Performance suitable for production use

### 5. Cross-Language Client Support
**Goal**: Generate TypeScript/JavaScript clients with full type safety from Rust definitions

**Key Deliverables**:
- Type generation pipeline (using ts-rs or similar)
- JavaScript/TypeScript client library
- WebSocket/HTTP streaming support for web clients
- NPM package with proper TypeScript declarations
- Documentation and examples for frontend integration

**Success Criteria**:
- Automatic type synchronization between Rust and TypeScript
- Feature parity between Rust and JS clients
- Easy integration with popular frontend frameworks
- Comprehensive type checking in TypeScript projects

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Set up project structure and core dependencies
- Define base traits and data types
- Implement basic provider abstraction
- Create initial tool calling framework
- Implement agent helper functions (`stream_text`, `generate_text`)
- Define `RunUntil` trait and basic execution strategies

### Phase 2: Core Features
- Complete provider implementations for major AI services
- Finalize tool calling system with guards and validation
- Implement streaming protocol foundation
- Add comprehensive error handling

### Phase 3: Client Libraries
- Build type generation pipeline
- Create JavaScript/TypeScript client library
- Implement streaming support for web clients
- Add client-side error handling and reconnection

### Phase 4: Polish & Production
- Performance optimization and benchmarking
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Testing across different environments
- Package publishing and distribution

## Technical Considerations

### Flexibility Requirements
- Modular architecture allowing selective feature usage
- Plugin system for extending functionality
- Configuration-driven behavior where appropriate
- Backward compatibility strategy

### Performance Goals
- Minimal runtime overhead for abstractions
- Efficient streaming with low latency
- Memory-conscious design for long-running applications
- Async-first architecture throughout

### Developer Experience
- Clear, intuitive APIs following Rust conventions
- Comprehensive error messages and debugging support
- Rich documentation with practical examples
- Strong IDE support with proper type hints

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Easy onboarding for new users
- **Performance**: Competitive with direct provider SDKs
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and recovery
- **Extensibility**: Simple addition of new providers and tools
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees across the entire stack

## Future Considerations

- Support for additional AI modalities (audio, video)
- Integration with popular Rust web frameworks
- Cloud deployment and scaling patterns
- Monitoring and observability features
- Community contribution guidelines and governance
